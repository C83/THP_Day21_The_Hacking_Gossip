## Movie Database

We had to create a platform so that all the mousetons could come and write gossips, edit them and even destroy them all anonymously. <br/>

For this, we created an application that we produced on heroku at the following address: https://stark-cliffs-94925.herokuapp.com/gossips <br/>

* We generated a ```Gossip``` model to quickly have an```anonymous_author``` field and a ```content``` field.

* Our first page and our first routes were created from a ```static_pages_controller```

* We have added some Bootstrap for the beauty of the app

* We have set up a header and a body with a ```view``` for each.

* We had to set up a form so that the ```anonymous_author``` could add some content, for that we agreed with ```form``` then we went to ```form_for``` to view and use the form more easily.

* The application allows you to create a new ```gossip```, edit gossip, delete it and add some comments

* The exercise was done in full, good luck to the correctors and thanks.

## Now 

You can check the code of the application on github or clone it if the instructions ask for it, in this case do not forget to type ```bundle install``` once in the repo folder.
